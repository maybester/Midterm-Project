# Midterm-Project

## Project Planning
### Problem statement

This project is aimed to study the performance of each team and player across seasons from 1951 to 2022 and make predictions for the most possible winning team and highest scored players in the following seasons.

## Workflow

### Data Collection

### EDA

### Data modelling

Multiple linear regression with several training features was used for the model prediction. For the players ranking, our model was to predict players ranking (label) using training features such as points scored, Rebounds, assists, Personal Fouls, FT %, FG %, Minutes Played, etc.

For the teams, we developed a model predicting teams win ration as our label and using training features such as loss, pace, win percentage, rebounds, assists, turnovers, steals, blocks, plus/minus score, offensive rating, defensive rating, shooting percentage, etc.
For both prediction, 70% of our data was used to train our model and 30% for testing with an R2 score of 0.87 and 0.97 for our model testing on both players and teams respectively.
